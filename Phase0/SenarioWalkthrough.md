## Scenario Walkthrough

- When the program is run, the user is first asked (in the command line) if it is a USER or an AGENT.


- If the user selects that it is a USER, the system would ask if the user wants to sign-up or sign-in. For the sake of our scenario-walkthrough, we select the sign-up option.


- This prompts the user to input their name, email and phone number. The system asks the user if it is satisfied with its answers- to which the user replies – yes to continue. This creates the user object and the system then assigns a unique id to the user with which the user can sign-in later.


- When the user signs-in with this unique id, the system opens up a menu from where the user selects the option to book a flight. The user enters the arrival/departure destination and travel date.


- The system displays a list of available flights to the user in the command line. The user selects the desired flight. The system then prompts the user to enter which seat standard it wants – Economy/Business/First.


- Then the system displays a flight seating chart in the command line for the user to choose its seat. After the user has made its seat selection, the system asks the user if it wants to provide any baggage information, or proceed directly to meal preferences.


- The user chooses to proceed directly to meal selection at this stage.


- After the meal is selected, the system generates the ticket for the user and displays it on the command line screen.


- After the user chooses to book and pay for the ticket, the system prints the final ticket and takes the user back to the main menu.


- The user now chooses to end app use and exits the program.
