## Specification

We seek to create a program on the Domain of an Airline Ticket Reservation system.

- Our program should have a UI which would be able to accept sign-in/sign-up data from the user. The system would be able to accommodate for two different type of users – passengers and agents.


- The passengers would be able to search for flights based on their departure date and their arrival and departure destinations.


- They would also be able to book a ticket, cancel a ticket, reschedule a ticket, enter their meal preferences and their baggage data (details of both checked-in and cabin luggage).


- The user would also be able to choose their seat numbers on the flight and the standard of the ticket – Economy/Business/First.


- The users would also be able to enter their membership details – Standard/Sliver/Gold/Platinum member – to avail various discounts and privileges (like lounge access) on their ticket.


- If the user does not have any membership, the system automatically assigns them a Standard membership. The system automatically keeps adding miles (travel points) to the user’s account based on the number of tickets booked.


- The system would be able to calculate the final price of the ticket based on the user’s seat selection, meal preferences, baggage details and after applying any discounts the user may be eligible for based on their membership status.


- The system would also be able to combine together all the above-mentioned data to create a ticket for the user.


- The agent would also be able to do all the same tasks as the user. The only difference would be that the agent would have different sign-in credentials and would be managing the ticket on behalf of their customers. The agent would be able to add and remove their respective customers.


- The system would also be able to keep track of the details of all the flights for a particular airline, including each flights departure date and arrival/departure destinations.
